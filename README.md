# poisson-2d
MATLAB-based finite element solver for Poisson's equation, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, on arbitrary polygonal domains in 2D.

Meshing is performed with Darren Engwirda's MESH2D, a very useful package for reliably generating triangular meshes. Check it out here: https://github.com/dengwirda/mesh2d.
